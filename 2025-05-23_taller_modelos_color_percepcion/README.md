# Color Models and Human Perception Visualization

This project explores different color models and human color perception through image processing and visualization using Python.

---

## Objective

- Understand and visualize the RGB, HSV, and CIE Lab color spaces.  
- Simulate common types of color vision deficiencies (color blindness): Protanopia and Deuteranopia.  
- Explore image appearance under low light conditions by adjusting brightness and contrast.
