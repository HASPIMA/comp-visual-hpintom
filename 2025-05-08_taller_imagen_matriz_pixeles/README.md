# Image Matrix Workshop â€“ Pixels as Data

## Date
2025-05-08

---

## Objective

Understand how digital images are represented as matrices and learn to manipulate regions, color channels, and intensity using OpenCV and NumPy.

---

## Tools

- Python (OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Google Colab

## Tasks Completed

- Loaded a color image with `cv2.imread()`
- Displayed RGB and HSV channels separately
- Modified a rectangular region (color fill)
- Replaced one region with another
- Plotted histograms for each color channel
- Adjusted brightness and contrast with `convertScaleAbs()`

## Visual Results

Results:
Image channel outputs:
![Red channel](./results/redChannel.png)
![Green channel](./results/greenChannel.png)
![Blue channel](./results/blueChannel.png)

Additional modifications:
![Modified regions](./results/others.png)
![Histogram or brightness/contrast](./results/others2.png)

These are saved in the `/results/` folder.

## Reflection

This workshop clarified how images work as matrices and how easy it is to manipulate pixels directly. Visualizing channels and adjusting regions helped reinforce pixel-level understanding of image data.
