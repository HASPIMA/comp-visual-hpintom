# Workshop - Analysis of Geometric Shapes: Centroid, Area, and Perimeter

## Date

2025-05-08

## Workshop Objective

Detect simple shapes (circles, squares, triangles) in binarized images and calculate
geometric properties such as area, perimeter, and centroid. The objective is to
develop skills to extract relevant metrics from detected contours in processed images.
