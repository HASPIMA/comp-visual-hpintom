# Workshop - Analysis of Geometric Shapes: Centroid, Area, and Perimeter

## Date

2025-05-08

## Workshop Objective

Detect simple shapes (circles, squares, triangles) in binarized images and calculate
geometric properties such as area, perimeter, and centroid. The objective is to
develop skills to extract relevant metrics from detected contours in processed images.

## Concepts Learned

- Image Contours: Understanding how OpenCV detects and represents shape boundaries
- Geometric Properties:
  - Area calculation for irregular shapes
  - Perimeter measurement using contour points
  - Centroid computation from contour moments
- Binary Image Processing:
  - Thresholding techniques for shape detection
  - Contour detection in binary images
- Shape Analysis:
  - Contour approximation methods
  - Shape classification based on geometric properties
  - Moment calculations for shape features

## Tools and Environments

- Python 3.13.2
  - `opencv-python`: For image processing and computer vision tasks.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations and array manipulations.
  - `imageio`: For creating GIF images.
  - `IPython`: For displaying images in Jupyter notebooks.
- Visual Studio Code: for editing, running and debugging Python code.
