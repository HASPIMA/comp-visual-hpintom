# Project: Visualizing Orthographic and Perspective Projections in 3D

This project demonstrates the difference between orthographic and perspective projections using multiple technologies:

- **Python:** Generates 3D points and visualizes their 2D projections using matrices. The Python code is implemented and available on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zEMMRM8_yKL6YSp98GRTnXriHL7tBng5?usp=sharing).  
- **Processing:** Interactive 3D sketch that lets you switch between orthographic and perspective cameras with rotating spheres.  
- **Three.js (React):** Web app with routes showing scenes rendered with orthographic and perspective cameras, including user controls.

## Project Structure

- `/python`: Python scripts using NumPy and Matplotlib for projection visualizations, available on Colab.  
- `/processing`: Processing sketches for interactive 3D visualization.  
- `/threejs`: React application using React Three Fiber and React Router.

### Three.js

- PENDING  
  - Screenshots (`PNG`) of the scene rendered with orthographic and perspective cameras (two separate images).

## Conclusion

This project provides practical, visual comparisons of orthographic versus perspective projections across different programming environments, helping to intuitively understand the effects of projection types on 3D visualization.
