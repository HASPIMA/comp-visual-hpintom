# Project: Visualizing Orthographic and Perspective Projections in 3D

This project demonstrates the difference between orthographic and perspective projections using multiple technologies:

- **Python:** Generates 3D points and visualizes their 2D projections using matrices.  
- **Processing:** Interactive 3D sketch that lets you switch between orthographic and perspective cameras with rotating spheres.  
- **Three.js (React):** Web app with routes showing scenes rendered with orthographic and perspective cameras, including user controls.  
- **Unity:** *(Pending)* Intended to have a 3D scene with camera switching.



## Project Structure

- `/python`: Python scripts using NumPy and Matplotlib for projection visualizations.  
- `/processing`: Processing sketches for interactive 3D visualization.  
- `/threejs`: React application using React Three Fiber and React Router.  
- `/unity`: Placeholder folder for future Unity implementation.


## Expected Results and Deliverables

## Conclusion

This project provides practical, visual comparisons of orthographic versus perspective projections across different programming environments, helping to intuitively understand the effects of projection types on 3D visualization.
