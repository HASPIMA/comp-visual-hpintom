# Workshop - Rasterization from Scratch: Drawing with Classic Algorithms

## Date

2025-05-08

## Workshop Objective

To understand and implement classic rasterization algorithms for lines, circles,
and triangles, understanding how images are built pixel by pixel on a screen.
The objective is to develop a solid foundation on how graphic primitives
are generated without using high-level libraries.

## Concepts Learned

- Rasterization
- Classic rasterization algorithms
  - Bresenham for lines
  - Midpoint for circles
  - Scanline for triangles

## Tools and environments

- Python 3.13.2 (Jupyter Notebook)
  - Pillow: to create and manipulate images
  - numpy: for numerical operations
  - matplotlib: for visualization
